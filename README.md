## Purpose

Base64 encoding is commonly used in applications like email encoding, data storage, and transferring binary data over text-based protocols. However, during penetration testing or digital forensics investigations, there might be a need to decode encoded data to extract meaningful information. This tool simplifies the process by providing an easy-to-use graphical interface.

## Features

### User-Friendly Interface
  - A clean and intuitive design, suitable for both beginners and professionals.
  - Interactive text areas for input and output.

### Error Handling

  - Alerts the user if the input field is empty.
  - Displays error messages if the decoding process fails due to invalid Base64 input.

### Customizable and Lightweight

  - Built using Python and the Tkinter library, ensuring portability and compatibility.
  - Can be easily modified to include additional functionality if needed.
